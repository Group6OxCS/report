 
I implemented the following features:
 
 1. I worked solely on the layout of the level and the visual impact of the game-experience. I was able to pull together different element that othere group-members worked on such as obstacles, trees etc. in order to enhance the visual impact of the game.

2. Additionally, I, alongisde two other team-members are running the final presentation, in which we will demo our product, run through the process of modifying an API and then going on to analyse its inheritance.
