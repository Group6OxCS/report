 I have implemented the following game features:
  - Obstacles: I created the obstacles for the game, which includes tire stacks and varieties of burning cars - the latter of which required animated effects
  - Soundtrack: I implemented the features to allow music to be playing in the background, and sourced some sample audio tracks
